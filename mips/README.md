# MIPS Assembly

MIPS QtSpim implementations of the same computational problems from HW3. All programs follow MIPS calling conventions.

- sequence.s: Computes S_N = N^3 − 3 from console input.
- recurse.s: Fully recursive implementation of f(N) with caller/callee register discipline.
- draft.s: Reads players interactively (three fields per player), dynamically allocates using sbrk, stores into a linked list, sorts alphabetically, and prints formatted output.
