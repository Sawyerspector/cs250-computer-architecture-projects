# Digital Logic (Logisim Evolution)

This folder contains circuits built entirely from primitive gates, DFFs, splitters, and multiplexers.

- circuit1a.circ: Implementation of a composite Boolean expression using XOR, OR, AND.
- circuit1c.circ: Circuit produced from a hand-minimized sum-of-products expression.
- my_adder.circ: Fully functional 16-bit adder/subtractor with overflow detection.
- scorer.circ: A Moore finite-state machine modeling possession/timeout logic with synchronous state transitions.
